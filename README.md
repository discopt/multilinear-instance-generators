# Generators for multilinear optimization problems

This project contains Python code for generating instances for various multilinear optimization problems.

## Low auto-correlation binary sequences

Generators are:
* [low-auto-correlation-binary-monomialwise.py](/low-auto-correlation-binary-monomialwise.py)
* [low-auto-correlation-binary-cardinalitywise.py](/low-auto-correlation-binary-cardinalitywise.py)
