# Generators for multilinear optimization problems

This project contains Python code for generating instances for various multilinear optimization problems.

## Low auto-correlation binary sequences

Generators are:
* [low-auto-correlation-binary.py](/low-auto-correlation-binary.py) for the PIP file.
* [low-auto-correlation-binary-monomialwise.py](/low-auto-correlation-binary-monomialwise.py) for an LP file with a monomial-wise linearization.
* [low-auto-correlation-binary-cardinalitywise.py](/low-auto-correlation-binary-cardinalitywise.py) for an LP file with a cardinality-wise linearization.

## Random image restoration problems

Generators are:
* [random-image-restoration.py](/random-image-restoration.py) for the PIP file.
